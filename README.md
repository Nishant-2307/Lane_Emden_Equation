# Numerically Solving Lane-Emden Equation to Analyze Stellar Structure

## Overview
This project focuses on the numerical solution of the Lane-Emden equations to explore the intricate structure and evolution of stars. By leveraging computational techniques, we aim to determine essential stellar parameters such as radius, mass, and density with high precision.

Stellar physics is a cornerstone of astrophysical research, offering profound insights into the lifecycle and behavior of stars. The Lane-Emden equations, formulated by Jonathan Lane and Robert Emden, provide a mathematical description of the density distribution within a star under the influence of self-gravity and pressure forces. This research employs numerical methods to delve deeper into the structure and evolution of stars, enhancing our understanding of these celestial bodies.

Developed and Implemented Numerical Algorithms: Created efficient numerical algorithms, including the Runge-Kutta and Euler's methods, to solve the Lane-Emden equations for a diverse set of stellar models.
Explore Stellar Evolution: Investigating the structural evolution of stars across different spectral classes, ages, and evolutionary phases using numerical solutions to derive precise stellar parameters such as radius, mass, and density.
